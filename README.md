# Responsive

So today we learn about responsive.

The days past good, all was very fine. 

I've finished the exercice ( 2 media queries of 3).
I pushed the entire project on my github. After anything was the same, all is not a the good place, my code was not responsive like i've get in offline.

I close everythings, re-open, and all was gone, nothing is good, i don't understand but it disgust me a lot.

Is not a problem, I go forward, I can come back for try later !
